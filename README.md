# Phrase Tutor

An interesting way to learn languages through learning phrases. Available at [phrasetutor.com](https://phrasetutor.com/).

The method is simple: 

1. there is a pool of phrases we want to learn e.g. (”Hello”, “Ciao”)
2. first, ask each of those questions
3. if you know the answer, remove the fact out of the pool
4. if you didn’t, keep it
5. repeat with the smaller pool, and repeat it until the pool is empty
